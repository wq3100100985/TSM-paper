\begin{abstract}
In this work, we propose a multi-channel charge-based capacitance measurement (MCCBCM) technique for parasitic capacitances extraction of MOSFETs. The proposed technique is developed from a leakage- and parasitic-insensitive CBCM technique, which is applied to measure gate-to-channel capacitance in certain regimes. Using the multi-channel CBCM technique, we can measure all of the parasitic capacitance components of a MOSFET which are related to its terminals, such as the gate-to drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$), gate-to-source capacitance ($C_{GS}$), gate-to-bulk capacitance ($C_{GB}$), and so on. We designed a complex control methodology for the multi-channel CBCM circuit. Specific control methods are provided for different parasitic capacitance components when MOSFETs work in different regimes. We can measure capacitances of sub-femto-farad level in all regimes,  including the accumulation, depletion and inversion regimes.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{arasitic} capacitances have become a critical issue regarding the scale of advanced MOS devices. To extract parasitic capacitances in advanced technology nodes, measurement method with LCR meter no longer meet the accuracy requirements \cite{1,2}. Charge-based capacitance measurement (CBCM) techniques are much more accurate, but they only measure gate capacitance in certain regimes \cite{3,4,5,6}. Using analytical models is an efficient method to extract the theoretical values \cite{7,8,9}, but since the capacitances of advanced technology MOSFETs are sub-femto-farad level, the theoretical values must be verified with experimental measurement results. In this paper, we aim to provide such results.   


The multi-channel CBCM (MCCBCM) technique is proposed based on a leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM technique \cite{5}, which is applied to measure gate-to-channel capacitance in certain regimes. In the MCCBCM circuit, each terminal of the MOSFET under test is connected to an individual "channel". We designed a complex control methodology for these channels to ensure each component of MOSFET's parasitic capacitances can be measured, including the gate-to-drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$), gate-to-source capacitance ($C_{GS}$), gate-to-bulk capacitance ($C_{GB}$), and junction capacitance ($C_{DB}$ or $C_{SB}$). Moreover, potential at every terminal is controllable, combining with a four-point Kelvin method, the experimental measurement results is available when MOSFETs work in all regimes: from accumulation to depletion, and to inversion regime. The entire chip is realized in the form of device matrix array (DMA), so that different sizes of devices under test (DUT) are available. 

To introduce the MCCBCM technique, first, we present its circuit structure in Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}. Then, in Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, we provide the specific control method that corresponds to different components of MOSFETs' parasitic capacitances and different regimes. In Section \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral4}, we present a part of our measurement result to verify our technique.

\section{The MCCBCM Circuit Structure}

The MCCBCM circuit extends from a proposed leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM technique in \cite{5}. Compared with other CBCM methods, the leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM has the advantage of being insensitive to unwanted parasitic capacitances. Two factors must be taken into consideration when we design the MCCBCM circuit. First, because the parasitic capacitance components of MOSFETs are very complicated, when on components is under test, other components must not disturb the measurement process. Second, since we're going to do the measurement in all regimes, the potential difference between a MOSFET's different terminals may cause large IR drop to the switches of CBCM circuits. 


\subsection{The Leakage- and Parasitics-insensitive CBCM Technique}

Fig.\ref{Fig1} shows the illustration of the leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM technique and its accompanying waveform. The test structure contains two channels, each of which connects to one terminal of the device under test (DUT). Each channel contains two paths: a the positive path, and a negative path. Terminal "A" is charged through the positive path by $V_{PA}$ and discharged through the negative path by $V_{NA}$, and terminal "B" is similar. Two clock signals, clk0 and clk1, are applied to control the charge and discharge processes of terminals "A" and "B". There is a small phase delay between clk0 and clk1, so that the charge and discharge currents of terminal "A" can be completely recorded without the  switching delay effect.  


The operating process of this test structure is described as follows. First, clk0 is on and terminal "A" is pre-charged. $V_{PA}$ should be equal to $V_{NA}$ to reduce the effect of the error charge current and leakage current. After a small phase delay, clk1 turns on, and terminal "B" is charged. The corresponding charge current $I_{PA}$ is measured at terminal "A". The discharge process is the opposite. The discharge current is $I_{NA}$. Commonly only $I_{NA}$ is measured because it contains a smaller leakage current. Then the DUT capacitance is expressed as


%Equation (1)
\begin{align}
  C_{DUT}(V_{AB})=-\frac{\partial Q_{na}(V_{AB})}{\partial V_{AB}}=-\frac{\partial I_{NA}(V_{AB})}{\partial V_{AB}\cdot f_{clk}}
\end{align}
where $V_{AB}=V_{PA}-V_{PB}$ and $f_{clk}$ is the frequency of clk0 and clk1. By varying $V_{PB}$ by a tiny value $\Delta V$, and measuring the variation of $I_{NA}$, we can derive the DUT capacitance from a numerical differential calculation.

\end{figure}




A capacitor is a two-terminal device. In the leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM circuit, each terminal is connected to a external port through a group of controllable switches, which we call a "channel". Because a MOSFET device is a four-terminal device, we design four channels to connect these terminals, then the parasitic capacitances related to these terminals can be extracted. Using some control signals, we can select every two channels for the capacitance measurement. Then, the parasitic capacitance between two selected terminals can be measured, and other deselected channels will provide the bias voltage to the DUT MOSFET. Hence, the parasitic capacitances of DUT MOSFETs can be extracted in all regimes.  

Fig.\ref{Fig2} shows the test structure of the MCCBCM to measure a MOSFET device. Each channel contains at least two paths: the positive path is controlled by signal $ctrl\_PX$ (X represents G, D, S or B); the negative path is controlled by signal $ctrl\_NX$. The terminals of the DUT MOSFET are charged through the positive paths by $V_{PX}$ and discharged through the negative paths by $V_{NX}$. Two extra paths are required in the drain and source terminals to realize a four-point Kelvin measurement. When MOSFET works the in inversion regime, the four-point Kelvin measurement is necessary to remove the effect of the parasitic IR drop. 


Using the control signals $ctrl\_PX$ and $ctrl\_NX$, we can select every two channels for the capacitance measurement. Then, the parasitic capacitance between two selected terminals can be measured. Other deselected channels will provide bias voltage to the DUT MOSFET. Hence the DUT MOSFET can work in all regimes, and we can perform the measurement in all regimes.

The control signals $ctrl\_PX$ and $ctrl\_NX$ are generated by a combinational circuit, which is shown in the right side of Fig.\ref{Fig2}. We designed two selection commands $sel\_clk\_X$ and $sel\_channel\_X$ to control the generation of $ctrl\_PX$ and $ctrl\_NX$. Table \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} shows the value of $ctrl\_PX$ given by the combination of these two selection commands. The command $sel\_channel\_X$ decides whether the channel is controlled by the clock signal. If so, $sel\_clk\_X$ selects which clock to use control this channel. At least two channels should be controlled by clock signals: one is controlled by clk0 and the other is controlled by clk1. The ultimate purpose is to create a leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM structure. The specific control method will be shown in the next section. As some of the parasitic capacitances measurement is seriously impacted by the parasitic IR drop. Different control method is needed corresponding to the impact of parasitic IR drop.

\section{Specific Control Methods for Different Parasitic Capacitance Components and Different Regimes}

When a MOSFET works in the accumulation or depletion regime, its channel is cut off and each of its four terminals is isolated from the others. However, when a MOSFET works in the inversion regime, its channel will turn on. The drain and source terminals are connected. The parasitic resistances in the drain and source channels may cause a large parasitic IR drop, which will introduce an error in the final results. According to the impact of the parasitic IR drop, we designed two different control methods of the MCCBCM circuit.



\subsection{Control Method when the Parasitic IR Drop is Negligible}

When the parasitic IR drop is negligible, we can simply turn the MCCBCM structure into an equivalent leakage- and parasitic-insensitive CBCM structure. Consider the measurement of $C_{GD}$ as an example. First, we should select the gate and drain channels for the capacitance measurement. Therefore, $sel\_channel\_G$ and $sel\_channel\_D$ are set to "0", $sel\_channel\_S$ and $sel\_channel\_B$ are set to "1". Second, we set $sel\_clk\_G$ to "0" and $sel\_clk\_D$ to "1". Then the gate and drain channels are controlled by clk0 and clk1 respectively. The entire test structure is equivalent to the leakage- and parasitic-insensitive CBCM, and the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig.\ref{Fig3a}. We also make the potential $V_{PG}$ equal to $V_{NG}$, and record the charge current at port $V_{NG}$ as $I_{NG}$. According to the former section, the measured $C_{GD}$ is 

%Equation (1)
\begin{align}
  C_{GD}(V_{GD})=-\frac{\partial Q_{NG}}{\partial V_{GD}}=-\frac{\partial I_{NG}}{\partial V_{GD}\cdot f_{clk}}
\end{align}

We divide the measurement process into two steps to calculate the numerical differentiation. The only difference between them is the tiny variation of $V_{PD}$ ($\Delta V$). Because the channel of MOSFET is cut off, $\Delta V$ will not make $V_{S}$ vary. The potential variation at the drain and source terminals, and the charge current variation are shown in Fig.\ref{Fig3b}. We record the variation of discharge as $\Delta Q_{NG}$; then, $C_{GD}$ is derived as 




%Equation (2)
\begin{align}
  C_{GD}(V_{GD})=-\frac{\Delta Q_{NG}}{\Delta V}
\end{align}

\subsection{Control Method when Parasitic IR Drop is not Negligible}
When the MOSFET works in the inversion regime, the parasitic IR drop at the drain and source terminals are not negligible. To eliminate the effect of the parasitic IR drop, we add a four-point Kelvin measurement structure into our test circuit.

Consider the measurement of $C_{GD}$ as an example. If measured by the method in Section A, the potential variation at the source terminal ($\frac{R_{PS}}{R_{tot}} \Delta V$) will introduce an error to the final result. As Fig.\ref{Fig3b} shows, this error only occurs when clk1 is on. Therefore to eliminate this error, we can add a reverse tiny voltage $\Delta V_{r}$ at the source channel when $clk1$ is on. There exists a certain $\Delta V_{r}$ which makes the potential at source terminal remain constant. Thus, the equivalent test structure after setting the control signals should be similar to Fig.\ref{Fig3c}. To realize the equivalent circuit in Fig.\ref{Fig3c}, $sel\_channel\_S$ is set to "0" and $sel\_clk\_S$ is set to "0".

The potential variation of the drain and source terminals is shown in Fig.\ref{Fig3d}. Without $\Delta V_{r}$, $\Delta V$ will cause the potential of the drain and source terminals ($V_{D}$ and $V_{S}$) to vary by $\Delta V_{D}$ and $\Delta V_{S}$, respectively. Through a simple calculation, we derive $\Delta V_{D}$=$\frac{R_{PD}+R_{ch}}{R_{tot}} \Delta V$ and $\Delta V_{S}$=$\frac{R_{PS}}{R_{tot}} \Delta V$ ($R_{ch}$ is the channel resistance of the DUT MOSFET, where $R_{tot}=R_{PD}+R_{ch}+R_{PS}$). The variation of $V_{S}$ will cause an error to the measurement of $C_{GD}$. We should find a certain $\Delta V_{r}$ to eliminate this variation. The variation of $V_{D}$ will change to $\Delta V{1}$. 


However, both $\Delta V_{r}$ and $\Delta V_{1}$ are unknown and are determined by a four-point Kelvin measurement. Because both $\Delta V$ and $\Delta V_{r}$ are added in the positive paths, we set all of channel selection commands ($sel\_channel\_X$) to "1", so that only positive paths are turned on. Two extra paths at the drain and source channels are also turned on to realize the four-point Kelvin measurement. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig.\ref{Fig3e}. Then, we will determine the value of $\Delta V_{r}$ and $\Delta V_{1}$ in two steps. First, we measure the initial potentials $V_{d}$ and $V_{s}$ at the ports $Dsense$ and $Ssense$, respectively. Second, we increase $V_{PD}$ by $\Delta V$ and $V_{PS}$ by $\Delta V_{r}$. Then, we gradually vary $\Delta V_{r}$ until the potential at port $Ssense$ returns to the initial value. We record the corresponding value of $\Delta V_{r}$, and the variation of the potential at port $Dsense$ as $\Delta V_{1}$. 

Then, we can apply $\Delta V_{r}$ to the $C_{GD}$ measurement. $\Delta V$ and $\Delta V_{r}$ are simultaneously added to the test circuit. We record the variation of discharge at the gate terminal as $\Delta Q_{NG1}$, and $C_{GD}$ is derived by  

%Equation (3)
\begin{align}
  C_{GD}(V_{GD})=-\frac{\Delta Q_{NG1}}{\Delta V_{1}}
\end{align}


Other parasitic capacitances can be similarly characterized. If the parasitic resistance at the selected terminals can be neglected, such as $C_{GB}$ in all regimes and $C_{GS}$ in the accumulation and depletion regimes, use the method in section A. Otherwise, use the method in section B.

\section{Chip Architecture and Measurement Results}
 
Fig.\ref{Fig4a} shows the chip architecture. The chip is structured in the form of a device matrix array (DMA), so that different sizes of DUT MOSFETs can be efficiently measured. The DMA contains 16 rows, each of which contains 15 MCCBCM units and one reference unit. The $Row\_Sel$ block is applied to select the rows, and the $Col\_Sel$ blocks are applied to select the measurement units. The reference units do not contain DUT MOSFETs and are used to eliminate useless parasitic capacitances. This chip is fabricated using a 180 nm CMOS process with six metallic interconnect layers. The chip micrograph is shown in Fig.\ref{Fig4b}.

We have measured several N-channel MOSFETs with different channel widths and lengths. Fig.\ref{Fig5a}, Fig.\ref{Fig5b} and Fig.\ref{Fig5c} show the C-V curves of the gate-to-drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$), gate-to-bulk capacitance ($C_{GB}$) and drain-to-bulk capacitance ($C_{DB}$). In Fig.\ref{Fig5a}, each curve records the C-V characterization from the accumulation regime to the inversion regime. In the accumulation regime, because the MOSFET channel is cut off, $C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.18) \approx C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.54) \approx \frac{1}{2} C_{GD}(W/L=1/0.18)$. In the strong inversion regime, MOSFET channel turns on, and the relationship among them is $C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.18) \approx \frac{1}{3} C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.54) \approx \frac{1}{2} C_{GD}(W/L=1/0.18)$. In Fig.\ref{Fig5b}, we measured $C_{GB}$ from the depletion to the inversion regime. Because of the effect of the effective channel length, $C_{GB}(W/L=0.5/0.54)>3C_{GB}(W/L=1/0.18)$ in the depletion regime. And in Fig.\ref{Fig5c}, we measured $C_{DB}$ in the depletion regime regardless of the channel length. Therefore, the relationship between them is $C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.18)>C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.18) \approx \ C_{GD}(W/L=0.5/0.54)$, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis. 

We have also measured the parasitic C-V curve of a single N-channel MOSFET in different regimes. When $V_{D}$ remains constant (0 V) and $V_{S}$ varies, when $V_{G}$ sweep from 0 to 1.8 V, working regime of the N-channel MOSFET varies from accumulation regime to inversion regime. Fig.\ref{Fig5d}, Fig.\ref{Fig5e} and Fig.\ref{Fig5f} show the C-V curve of gate-to-channel capacitance ($C_{GC}$), gate-to-drain capacitance ($C_{GD}$) and gate-to-bulk capacitance ($C_{GB}$), $C_{GC}$=$C_{GD}$+$C_{GS}$. According to our SPICE simulation results of the BSIM3 model, these C-V curves have the same variation trend with the theoretical model. 

Therefore, according to our measurement result, parasitic capacitances of sub-femto-farad level is derived accurately. It is for the first time that all components of the same MOSFET's parasitic capacitances is measured with such a high accuracy, and when the MOSFET works in all regimes. 








\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we provide a precise method to characterize the parasitic capacitances of MOSFET devices in all regimes. We extend a leakage- and parasitics-insensitive CBCM technique and propose a multi-channel charge-based capacitance measurement (MCCBCM) technique for the first time. With this technique, we can measure all of the components of the parasitic capacitances of MOSFETs. Specific measurement processes are provided when we measure different components in different regimes. We also designed a device matrix array (DMA) to efficiently measure MOSFETs with different sizes. The MCCBCM technique is validated by analyzing our measurement results to determine whether they are theoretically correct. Some analytical models of MOSFET in advanced technology can now be verified with our technique.
